Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) Code Repository
This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook files, each focusing on different aspects of Bayesian Neural Networks and the Bayesian by Backpropagation technique.

Contents

BNN_MNIST.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network for classifying the MNIST dataset. It includes a step-by-step guide to building and training a Bayesian model for image classification using PyTorch.

BNN_Regression.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook focuses on Bayesian Neural Networks for regression tasks. It provides a practical example of using BNNs for regression problems, including data preprocessing, model construction, and evaluation.

BayesByBackprop.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook explores the Bayesian by Backpropagation method, which is a variational inference technique for training Bayesian Neural Networks. It includes detailed explanations and code examples of how to implement this technique using PyTorch.

Usage
Each Jupyter Notebook is self-contained and includes code, explanations, and examples. To use these notebooks, follow the instructions provided within each file. You may need to install the necessary dependencies and libraries as specified in the notebooks.
